Some stuff I made

morsecode.exe & morsecode.py

can convert text to morse code and morse code back to text.
the first prompt asks if you want to convert text to morse code or morse code to text, type True if you want to convert text to morse code and False for the opposite.
the second prompt asks what you want to translate.
if you want to translate text to morse code, it will only take lowercase letters, numbers, and spaces.
if you want to translate morse code to text, separate each letter with a space and each word with a / (i.e: . -..- .- -- .--. .-.. . / - . -..- -).

Turing Machine

the Turingpics folder and the turing.txt are both needed for the .exe or .py to work.
Click on the box in the top right to write to any cell, type in what cell you want to edit then what you want to change it to (can only be a number) (example: 40 1), then hit enter to change it.
Click on the box in the top left to automatically move to any cell, type in what cell you want to go to like with the write text box and then hit enter.
The bottom buttons on the left and right move you one cell left and one cell right.
There is one bug where you have to press a number key between backspaces on the top left and right text boxes.
