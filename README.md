Some stuff I made

morsecode.exe & morsecode.py

can convert text to morse code and morse code back to text.
the first prompt asks if you want to convert text to morse code or morse code to text, type True if you want to convert text to morse code and False for the opposite.
the second prompt asks what you want to translate.
if you want to translate text to morse code, it will only take lowercase letters, numbers, and spaces.
if you want to translate morse code to text, separate each letter with a space and each word with a / (i.e: . -..- .- -- .--. .-.. . / - . -..- -).
